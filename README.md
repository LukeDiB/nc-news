-* General Info *-
This app was created as a means to present what I've learned on the Northcoders bootcamp.

It is a forum style FE project, allowing users to view and comment on blog posts/articles.

The frontend is linked to a backend that I also created and can be viewed here: https://github.com/LukeDiB/forum-based-backend

-* Running the app locally *-
To run this app in a local environment first create a new folder, then open your preferred source code editor, open up a terminal and cd into the new folder. 

Clone down the project by typing in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/LukeDiB/nc-news

Next, in your terminal type:
npm i install

Once installed, in your terminal type:
npm run dev

This should start your local version of the app and give you a localhost link ending in a port. Cmd/Ctrl + click on the link and it will open in your browser

You now have a local version of the app

-* Minimum node version *-
v21.6.0
